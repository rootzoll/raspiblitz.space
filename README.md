A homepage for the RaspiBlitz project

### How to build the page

Node.js - 14.18.0, v16.12.0, or higher.
Text editor - We recommend VS Code with our Official Astro extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode

```
npm install
npm run build
```

You then find the compiled page in: `docs` folder. This folder is needed so that the resulting page can be hosted by github-pages.
